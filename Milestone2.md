# CMSC 436 Milestone 2: Health App

## Project Group 42
- Jay Desmarais
- Vernon Edejar

### Milestone 2: April 22, 2023
- A way to enter meals into the app and select a meal category (breakfast, lunch, dinner, or snack), add a name, date, and calories
- A way to enter a water intake goal and water intake for the day
- A scrolling view to see entered water and meals
- A counter for the calories eaten in a day

The above milestone has been completed and although we are behind the projected timeline by 2 days, we plan to stick to the same milestone schedule.

### Tasks Accomplished
- Adding a tabbar item to add meals (plus sign)
- Adding a sorted list of all completed meals that can be clicked on to navigate to the more detailed view/edit page
- Adding a calorie counter that counts the last week worth of calories ingested
- Adding a water tracker with a progress bar for the current day with a + and - button to change the daily water intake
- Adding a water goal that can be edited
- Adding a picker to choose which meal type you would like to view

### Difficulties Encountered
- There were some dificulties with lost code on Vernon's side, which led to the delay in getting this part of the project completed.
- We were unsure of the best way to display some of the information or ways to edit said information while keeping it consistent with the rest of the app. i.e. How to add and edit meals and portray them in a way that makes sense and is consistent with activities, even though a user has multiple meals a day across 4 categories vs the typical 1 activity a day across a wider range of categories.
