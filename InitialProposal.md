# CMSC 436 Project Proposal: Health App

## Project Group 42
- Jay Desmarais
- Vernon Edejar

## App Description: 
The app we are designing will be a general health and wellness app. It will include things like calorie tracking, workout/activity trackers, water intake and sleep tracking, as well as a mood journal/tracker. This will allow the user to track a lot of various health items and connect them to their Apple Health app.

## Minimal Goals:

The app will contain lists of a user's meals, workouts, their water intake, and will be focused on comparing calories in VS calories out. The interface will also allow them to add and delete each of these entries.

A workout tab will let the user: 
- Track individual exercises within the workout as well as the reps, weight, etc.
- Track calories burned
- Set calory burn goals

A meal/water tab will let the user:
- Track food for each meal of the day
- Track calories and macros for the meal
- Track water intake
- Set calorie and water intake goals

In addition to this, there will also be a way for users to add photos of their meals as they track them and a way to add selfies monthly (or weekly) to track their health journey as they work towards their fitness goals.

## Stretch Goals:
- Integrate the app into apples native HealthKit ecosystem to allow for tracking with apple watch and visibility of the same information in the Apple Health App.
