# CMSC 436 Milestone 3: Health App

## Project Group 42
- Jay Desmarais
- Vernon Edejar

### Milestone 3: April 26, 2023
- A way to add sub-exercises to each workout as well as the reps, weight, or time allotted for each exercise.
- A selection menu to view the data entered for a certain date
- A way to copy and edit previous meals or workouts
- A way to add photos to workouts/progress tracker and meals

The above milestone has been completed and we are behind the projected timeline by 4 days due to time taken to implement some new features. We no longer believe we will hit the stretch goal but have come up with various extra stretch goals that we may be able to hit.

### Tasks Accomplished
- Created a day view for the data on the page, so only counts and activities of a certain day would diaplay
- Added a navigation row for viewing info on a particular day
- Added a Sub-Activity Section to Activities to give the option to add or remove sub-activities and their properties (reps, weight, and time allotted)
- Added a button to create a copy activity (duplicate) and make edits to them individually.
- Added a button to delete a meal or workout as well as a confirmation menu to validate the decision.
- Added a way to add and delete photos from meals or activities.
- Added a picker to select the time of day you would like to view for your meals.
- Improved consistency of the app fonts and color scheming.
- Added an App Icon

### Difficulties Encountered
- The main difficulties that came with this phase were in the thinking of the best way to present and incorporate new elements and their current and potantial individual features or expansions with those of the rest of the app.
